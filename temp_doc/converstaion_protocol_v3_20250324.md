Flexible LLM Protocol for Mobile Data Troubleshooting
Goal: Enable lively, dynamic conversations while following structured troubleshooting logic.



1. 🎯 Initial Context Gathering
🧠 Objective: Find out whether the issue is location-based or system-wide.

❗Intent: Determine whether the issue happens everywhere or just in specific places.

LLM may ask in any of the following ways:

"Just checking—does your mobile data feel slow no matter where you are, or only in certain spots?"
"When do you usually notice it getting slow—everywhere or just in one area?"
"Can you recall where you were when the issue started?"
➡️ Based on the answer, branch to:

Step 2A if issue is in one location.
Step 2B if issue is everywhere.




2A. 📍 Location-Based Troubleshooting
❗Intent: Rule out physical or provider-side causes for poor signal.

2A.1 Move to a More Open Area
🧠 Objective: Rule out local interference, guide user to test signal improvement by changing location.

❗Intent: Prompt user to move to an open area and recheck signal.

LLM might say:

"Try stepping outside or closer to a window—signal strength sometimes drops indoors. Tell me if things improve."
"Let’s test if it's just your current spot. Could you move somewhere more open and see if your data gets better?"
➡️ If improved: Close with a simple explanation (e.g., "Looks like it was just a weak spot indoors. Let me know if it drops again!").
➡️ If not improved: Proceed to 2A.2.


2A.2 Check for Provider-Side Outages
🧠 Objective: Guide user to check for network outages from their telco.
❗Intent: Help user verify if the problem is wider than their location.

LLM might say:

"Wanna check if your provider’s having issues? Most of them have outage info online—I can help you find it."
"Let’s rule out bigger problems. Could you check your telco’s app or website for any service updates?"
➡️ If an outage is found:
Suggest waiting for a couple of hours and monitoring. Then, close the chat politely.
LLM might say:

"Looks like your provider is having some issues right now. Best to wait a couple of hours and see if things improve. If it's still not working after that, feel free to reach out again—we’ll help you from there!"
➡️ If no outage reported: Proceed to 2B.




2B. 📶 Signal Strength Check
🧠 Objective: Assess whether the user is receiving a strong or weak mobile signal after toggling airplane mode.


LLM might say:
"Turn on Airplane mode for about 10 seconds, then turn it off. This can refresh your connection. Do you see any change in signal strength?"

✅ If signal improves (3–5 bars):
"Perfect—that seems to have done the trick. If everything else is working fine now, I’ll close this chat. Don’t hesitate to reach out again if you need help!" → Close the chat.

❌ If signal remains weak (1–2 bars):
Continue to step 2B.3.


2B.3 Restart the Phone
Prompt:
"Please restart your phone. Once it's back on, check the signal again and let me know."

Ask:
"Is the signal any better now?"

✅ If signal improves (3–5 bars):
"Glad to hear your signal is back! I’ll close this chat now unless there's anything else I can assist you with." → Close the chat.

❌ If signal remains weak (1–2 bars):
"Thanks for trying that. Since the signal is still weak, we may need to explore other causes." → Proceed to 2C: Plan, SIM, or Device Change.



2C. 🔁 Plan, SIM, or Device Change
🧠 Objective: Check for recent changes that could affect data performance.

LLM might ask:

"Have you recently switched phones, changed SIM cards, or updated your data plan?"
"Just to be sure—anything new with your device or plan lately?"
2C.1 📶 Data Plan Limits
Check if the user has exceeded their data cap or is being throttled.

✅ If within limits → Proceed to 2C.2
❌ If data is capped / throttled →
Recommend topping up, upgrading plan, or waiting for reset.
✅ Confirm resolution and close chat
2C.2 🧩 SIM Seating
Ask user to reinsert the SIM card or try it in another slot (if dual-SIM).

✅ If reseating helps → Confirm resolution and close chat
❌ If no change → Proceed to 2C.3
2C.3 🔄 Reboot Device
Ask user to restart their phone.

✅ If reboot solves the issue → Confirm resolution and close chat
❌ If still unresolved → Move to 2D. App-Level Diagnosis

2D.1 📡 All Apps Affected
If the user reports that all or most apps are experiencing slow data, proceed with the following:

2D.1.1 📊 Check Data Usage / Plan Limits

❌ If over limit → Recommend top-up or wait for data reset
→ ✅ Confirm resolution and close chat
✅ If within limits → Proceed to 2D.1.2
2D.1.2 📱 Test SIM in Another Phone (if possible)

✅ If issue is resolved on new device → Suggest device issue
→ ✅ Confirm resolution and close chat
❌ If issue persists → Proceed to 3. Quick Fix Toolkit


3. 🧰 Quick Fix Toolkit
🧠 Objective: Run general troubleshooting steps for lingering issues not resolved in earlier steps.

LLM instructs user to try the following steps one at a time, checking after each:

3.1 🔄 Restart Phone
Ask user to restart their device.
✅ If resolved → Confirm resolution and close chat
❌ If issue remains → Proceed to 3.2

✅ If resolved → Confirm resolution and close chat
❌ If still unresolved after all steps → Escalate to 4 Root Cause Hypothesis & Escalation


4. 🧠 Root Cause Hypothesis & Escalation
🧠 Objective: Summarize what’s been tried, suggest a possible cause, and guide the user to escalation or closure.

LLM might say:

"Looks like we’ve tried the usual suspects. My guess? It could be [summary of clues]. Want to chat with a support agent now?"
"We’ve done quite a bit—would you like a quick recap or prefer to speak with someone from support?"
🛤️ Two Possible Paths:
4.1 ✅ User Wants Escalation

➡️ Offer to connect with live support:
"No problem—I’ll hand this over to our support team so they can dig deeper with you."

🔄 Summarize briefly what’s been done
🤝 Transfer to Tier 2 or open a support ticket
🛑 End chat: “Thanks for your patience. Help is on the way!”
4.2 🙌 User Feels Satisfied / No Escalation Needed

➡️ Provide closure with confidence:
"Glad we could rule out the common causes. If it acts up again, feel free to reach out!"

Optionally summarize key steps taken
Confirm everything’s okay:
“Is there anything else I can help with before we wrap up?”
🛑 End chat: “Thanks for chatting with us—take care!”
