AI Chatbot Protocol for Slow Mobile Data Issues
This structured flow ensures a smooth and logical troubleshooting process for mobile data issues.

1. Greeting & Context Understanding
Chatbot: "Hello! Iâ€™m here to help with your mobile data issues. Could you tell me if your data is slow everywhere or only in certain locations?"

If only in one location â†’ Proceed to Step 2A (Location-Based Troubleshooting).
If slow everywhere â†’ Proceed to Step 2B (Signal Strength Check).
2. Collect Basic Information & Provide Insights
A. Location-Based Troubleshooting
Chatbot: "Since your data is slow only in one location, it may be due to network congestion or weak signal strength. Letâ€™s check further."

âœ… Stepwise Solution:

Move to another location (e.g., outdoors, near a window) and check if the signal improves.
Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution, provide final advice, and close the chat.

ðŸ“Œ If the issue is resolved after moving:
Chatbot: "It looks like the issue was due to network conditions in that area. This can happen because of weak signal strength, temporary interference, or network congestion. If you often experience slow data in the same location, consider using Wi-Fi or contacting your provider to report a coverage issue. Let me know if you need anything else!"

If No â†’ Proceed to the next troubleshooting step.

Check for service outages:
Chatbot: "You can check for outages on your providerâ€™s website or mobile app. Would you like me to guide you through the process?"
If an outage is reported: Ask the user to wait two hours before checking again.
If no outage is reported: Proceed to Step 2B (Signal Strength Check).
B. Signal Strength Check
Chatbot: "How many signal bars do you see on your phone?"

If 3-5 bars (Good Signal): The issue may be due to network congestion, data plan limits, or device problems. Proceed to Step 2C (Plan, SIM, or Device Change Check).
If 1-2 bars (Weak Signal): The issue is likely due to poor reception.
âœ… Stepwise Solution for Weak Signal (1-2 Bars):

Move to an open area (outside, near a window) and check if the signal improves.

Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to the next troubleshooting step.
Enable Airplane Mode for 10 seconds, then disable it.

Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to the next troubleshooting step.
Restart your phone and check again.

Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
**If No â†’ Proceed to Step 2C (Plan, SIM, or Device Change Check).
C. Plan, SIM, or Device Change Check
Chatbot: "Did you recently change your data plan, SIM card, or device?"

If Yes:
âœ… Stepwise Solution:

Check your data plan details to see if there are any speed restrictions.
Restart your phone.
Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to the next troubleshooting step.
Ensure the SIM card is properly inserted.
Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
**If No â†’ Proceed to Step 2D (Affected Apps Check).
If No: Proceed to Step 2D (Affected Apps Check).

D. Affected Apps Check
Chatbot: "Is slow data affecting all apps or just specific ones?"

If all apps are affected:
âœ… Stepwise Solution:

Check if youâ€™ve reached your data usage limit.
Try testing mobile data on another device (if available).
Ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to Step 3 (Quick Fix Solutions).
If only specific apps (e.g., YouTube, WhatsApp) are slow:
âœ… Stepwise Solution:

Clear the appâ€™s cache.
Ask: "Is the affected app working properly now?"
If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to the next troubleshooting step.
Test other apps to confirm if the issue is app-specific.
Switch to a different network (Wi-Fi or another SIM) to check if the problem persists.
If the issue persists: Proceed to Step 3 (Quick Fix Solutions).
3. Quick Fix Solutions
If none of the above solutions worked, the chatbot suggests general troubleshooting steps:

âœ… Stepwise Solution:

Restart the phone.
Turn Airplane Mode ON for 10 seconds, then OFF.
Reset network settings (Provide OS-specific steps).
Check if background apps are consuming too much data.
After each step, ask: "Is your mobile data working normally now?"

If Yes â†’ Confirm resolution and close the chat.
If No â†’ Proceed to the next step.
If none of these solutions fix the issue â†’ Proceed to Step 4 (Escalation to Human Support).

4. Escalation to Human Support
If none of the previous steps resolve the issue:

Chatbot: "Iâ€™m sorry that your issue isnâ€™t resolved. Would you like me to connect you with a support agent for further assistance?"

âœ… Stepwise Solution:

If Yes â†’ Connect to a support agent.
