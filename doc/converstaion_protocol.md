0. 👋 Introduction & Issue Confirmation
📝 Data to Collect from the User:
Determine whether the user is experiencing a slow data issue and wishes to proceed with troubleshooting.

📌 Approaches for LLM to Collect the Required Data:
a. State the Purpose Clearly – Explain that the troubleshooting process is specifically designed to resolve slow data issues.
b. Confirm the User’s Issue – Directly ask the user if slow data is the problem they need help with.

Conditions to Determine the Next Step:
➡️ Proceed to Step 1 Initial Context, if the user confirms they are experiencing a slow data issue and wish to troubleshoot it.
➡️ Proceed to Step 51 Close the Chat, if the user does not wish to solve the slow data issue.
